Welcome to the FINOS Open Source Readiness Program.

We understand that financial services firms face unique obstacles on their road to open source collaboration, including legal & regulatory concerns, internal policies, cultural friction, and heavily restricted technology environments. FINOS supports our members every step of the way through our Open Source Readiness Program, which provides guidance and tools for new open source participants in financial technology.
