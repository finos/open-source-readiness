 The Open Source Maturity Model (OSMM) is a framework that helps organizations assess and improve their use of open source software. The primary purpose of the OSMM is to provide a structured way for organizations to evaluate their open source practices and identify areas for improvement. The model consists of a set of maturity levels, each with a defined set of characteristics and activities that an organization must achieve to move to the next level.

## Why Have an Open Source Maturity Model?

- The OSMM framework can help organizations to better understand the benefits and risks of using open source software and to establish policies and procedures to manage these effectively. 
- The model can also be used as a tool for benchmarking an organization's open source maturity against that of other organizations in the same industry or sector. 
- The OSMM can provide guidance to organizations on how to improve their open source practices and to align these with their overall business objectives. 
- The ultimate goal of an OSMM is to enable organizations to maximize the benefits of open source software while managing the associated risks and costs effectively.
- Since there are lots of [Activities](../Activities/Introduction) in this body of knowledge, the maturity levels provide some guidance about the _order_ to tackle activities.  Organisastions beginning their open source journey are advised to start with activities categorized as [Level 1](Level-1) and proceed from there.

## Existing Maturity Models

There are two pre-existing published open source maturity models at the time of writing which are both fairly similar.  The OSBOK attempts to synthesize these into a single whole:

- In December 2021, [The OSPO Alliance](https://ospo.zone) published on the [OW2](https://www.ow2.org) site the "[OW2 Open Source Good Governance Initiative](https://www.ow2.org/view/OSS_Governance/) which is a 5-level maturity model 

- In February 2022, the [TODO Group](todogroup.org) (a sub-foundation of the Linux Foundation) published "[The Evolution of the Open Source Program Office (OSPO)](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/the-evolution-of-the-open-source-program-office-ospo)" describing a five-level [OSPO](../Roles/OSPO) maturity model (Stages 0-4) based on its work with Bloomberg, Comcast and Porsche.  

Fortunately, there is common agreement between these two models about what practices are expected at each level.  Here, we adopt a 1-5 numbering scheme as this is more consistent with the original and most well-known maturity model, [CMMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration).

## The Five Levels

## Measuring Levels

Each level of the Open Source Maturity Model corresponds to a different set of [activities](../Activities/Introduction).  And, each activity is associated with a single maturity level.  

This means it is possible for an organization to be making progress on _multiple levels at the same time_:  they might be performing _all_ of the activities at [Level 1](Level-1) and [Level 2](Level-2) and _some_ of the activities of each of levels 3 to 5.  

Only by completing _all_ the activities at a given level and the levels below can an organization be regarded to be operating at that level.  (Unless there is some convincing reason for omitting to perform a given activity.)

## FINOS OSMM Survey

The FINOS [OSMM Survey](https://survey.osmm.finos.org/551476) can be answered in different ways:  as an individual, a function or the whole organisation.  The survey aims to:

 - Establish which activities the respondent is performing.   
 - Provide a maturity _level_ corresponding to these activities.
 - Give suggestions to the respondent about which activities need further work to move to a higher maturity level.
 
**NB:** The FINOS OSMM Survey is currently in beta.  Feedback on this would be [greatly appreciated](mailto:help@finos.org).
