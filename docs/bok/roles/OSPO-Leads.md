The Open Source Program Office (OSPO) is responsible for the overall management and direction of an organization's open source program. This includes managing the open source software inventory, identifying and managing legal and compliance risks, and ensuring that open source software is used in compliance with company policies and procedures.

The OSPO interacts with open source software by evaluating open source projects and components to determine whether they meet company standards and requirements, and by working with internal teams to ensure that they are aware of and are compliant with open source policies and procedures. They also work with external open source communities to ensure that the company is in compliance with open source licenses and contributing back to open source projects.
