Developers are responsible for designing, coding, and testing software applications. They are responsible for writing and maintaining code, troubleshooting and debugging software, and working with other developers to create and implement software solutions.

A developer interacts with open source software by using open source libraries, frameworks, and tools as building blocks for their software. They also contribute to open-source projects, fixing bugs, adding features, and submitting pull requests.
