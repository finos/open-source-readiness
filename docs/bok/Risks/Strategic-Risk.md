Strategic risk refers to the potential for adverse outcomes resulting from decisions made by an organization's leadership regarding its long-term goals, objectives, and competitive position. 

It involves analyzing and managing uncertainties associated with strategic planning, such as market changes, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer preferences.

> Strategic risk is the risk that failed business decisions may pose to a company.  Strategic risk is often a major factor in determining a company's worth, particularly observable if the company experiences a sharp decline in a short period of time. Due to this and its influence on compliance risk, it is a leading factor in modern risk management. - [Strategic Risk, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_risk)
