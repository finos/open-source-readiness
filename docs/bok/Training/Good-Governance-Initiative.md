The OSPO Alliance is built out of the OSS Good Governance Initiative (or GGI) blueprint developed by European open source organisations to help implement corporate-wide open source policies, and set up OSPOs. The methodology proposes a comprehensive approach based on five objectives (Goals) and a number of tasks (Activities) describing what steps should be implemented to build a successful OSPO.
