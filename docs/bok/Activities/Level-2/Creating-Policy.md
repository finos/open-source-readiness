**THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER**

Refer to [Policy](../../Artifacts/Policy) as the _output_ from this activity.

- should we split this into inbound and outbound?  They might be two separate things.  But I think you need to start the policy here.



<Excerpt link="https://todogroup.org/guides/create-program/#program-structure" title="Open Source Policy" from="TODO Group">

When drafting open source policies, among the many topics that need to be discussed are:

- How employees of your company can contribute to open source projects
- How your company can open source internal projects
- How your company accepts external contributions to their open source projects
- How to prepare for open source releases
- How approvals are received
- How developers can use open source code they find on GitHub and other code repositories
- Procedures and rules explaining how open source code can be brought into your company
- How the incoming code is catalogued so others know it is being used
- How a company can grow a community of like-minded external developers around it to keep it thriving
- Rules that help determine when code should be released as open source or kept as intellectual property

### The Policy

It can take a long time to get policy approved - you need people on-side to help build this from the policy team (expand). (1 year as an example)
