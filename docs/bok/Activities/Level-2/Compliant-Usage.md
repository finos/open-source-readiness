A quick reference guide for organisations at Level 2 maturity—establishing governance, compliance, and an OSPO for open source consumption.

At Level 1, open source usage happens organically but without visibility or control. Level 2 is about bringing structure to that usage. The case for investing in Level 2 maturity is compelling:

- **Security incidents are expensive.** Log4Shell demonstrated that organisations without software inventory couldn't quickly assess their exposure. The cost of scrambling to respond far exceeds the cost of knowing what you have.
- **Regulators are paying attention.** The EU Cyber Resilience Act and similar legislation are making software supply chain management a compliance requirement, not just a best practice.
- **License violations carry real risk.** Using open source without understanding license obligations can lead to litigation, forced code disclosure, or reputational damage.
- **Ad-hoc approaches don't scale.** As open source usage grows, informal processes break down. An OSPO provides the coordination needed to manage open source consistently across the organisation.
- **Level 2 enables Level 3.** You can't safely contribute to open source projects until you have the governance structures in place to manage that activity.

## 1. Creating an OSPO

An Open Source Program Office (OSPO) centralises open source governance and enables you to move from ad-hoc usage to structured consumption. Creating an OSPO is organisational change—you'll need to build a coalition, demonstrate value, and align with existing KPIs.

**See:** [Creating an OSPO](Creating-An-OSPO) for Kotter's 8-step change process applied to OSPO creation, including building urgency, forming coalitions, and generating quick wins.

**See:** [OSPO Structure](../../Artifacts/OSPO) for staffing models, reporting lines, and organisational placement.

## 2. Compliance & Risk Management

Using open source in a regulated firm requires understanding how it intersects with existing compliance frameworks. The Log4Shell incident demonstrated why open source supply chain risk needs formal controls.

**See:** [Compliant Open Source Consumption](Consumption-Compliance) for the three lines of defence model, the compliance function, and risk-and-control frameworks applied to open source.

**See:** [Creating Policy](Creating-Policy) for developing an open source consumption policy.

**See:** [Cyber Resilience Act Presentation](/docs/Presentations/Cyber-Resilience-Act) for how EU legislation is reshaping software supply chain compliance requirements.

**See:** [Legal Aspects of Open Source](/docs/Presentations/Legal-Implications-Of-Open-Source) for Aaron Williamson's guidance on compliance beyond license basics.

## 3. Software Inventory & Supply Chain Security

You can't manage what you can't see. Knowing what open source you're using—and where—is foundational to security and compliance.

**See:** [Software Inventory](Software-Inventory) for approaches to cataloguing open source usage across your estate.

**See:** [Supply Chain Security](Supply-Chain-Security) for vulnerability management, SBOM generation, and responding to incidents like Log4Shell.

**See:** [SBOMs](../../Artifacts/SBOMs) for Software Bill of Materials as an artifact.

**See:** [ORT (Open Source Review Toolkit) Presentation](/docs/Presentations/ORT) for how OSPOs are using ORT for compliance and inventory.

**See:** [FossID Presentation](/docs/Presentations/FossID) for SCA tooling and AI-assisted detection.

## 4. License Management

Open source licenses carry obligations. Using software without understanding its license can create legal risk.

**See:** [License Management](License-Management) for building an allow-list, reviewing licenses, and tooling for compliance.

**See:** [Licenses](../../Artifacts/Licenses) for understanding common license types and their implications.

**See:** [OpenChain Presentation](/docs/bok/osr-resources/OpenChain) for the ISO standard for open source license compliance.

## 5. Training

Staff need to understand the firm's approach to open source consumption, including how to evaluate components and comply with policy.

**See:** [Consumption Training](Consumption-Training) for curriculum guidance on safe open source consumption.

**See:** [Training Index](../../Training/Introduction) for Linux Foundation courses and other resources.
