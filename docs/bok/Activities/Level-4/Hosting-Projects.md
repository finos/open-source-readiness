A quick reference guide for organisations at Level 4 maturity—hosting, maintaining, and contributing projects to open source foundations.

## 1. Why Host Projects?

At Level 4, your organisation moves from contributing to _existing_ projects to hosting your _own_ open source projects. This can reduce maintenance burden by attracting external contributors, demonstrate technical leadership, and create industry standards around your approach.

**See:** [Why Create An Open Source Project](Why-To-Create-A-Project) for the business case and strategic rationale.

**See:** [Contributing A Firm Open Source Project](Open-Sourcing-A-Project) for the lifecycle of inception, incubation, active use, and archiving.

## 2. Communities & Foundations

A successful open source project needs a healthy community. This requires investment in documentation, communication, and engagement.

**See:** [8Knot Presentation](/docs/Presentations/8Knot) for Cali Dolfi's tool for open source community health analysis and contributor activity insights.

Open source foundations provide governance, legal support, and sustainability for projects. Contributing your project to a foundation can increase adoption, provide neutral governance, and reduce the burden on your organisation.

**See:** [Open Source Foundations](Foundations) for understanding the role of foundations, choosing one, and sponsorship options.

**See:** [Joining A Foundation](Joining-A-Foundation) for the practical steps of foundation membership.

**See:** [Incubation](Incubation) for the process of bringing a project into a foundation.

## 3. Maintaining Projects

Hosting a project means taking on maintainer responsibilities: managing contributions, responding to issues, ensuring security, and building community.

**See:** [Maintaining A Project](Maintaining-A-Project) for ongoing responsibilities of project maintainers.

**See:** [Outbound Security](Outbound-Security) for security considerations when publishing code.

---

## 4. Legal & IP Considerations

Publishing code externally requires careful attention to licensing, trademarks, and intellectual property.

**See:** [Licenses](../../Artifacts/Licenses) for choosing the right license for your project.

**See:** [CLAs and DCOs](../../Artifacts/CLAs-And-DCOs) for managing contributor agreements.

**See:** [IP Considerations](../../Artifacts/IP) for intellectual property implications of open sourcing.
