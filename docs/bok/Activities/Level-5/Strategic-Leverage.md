A quick reference guide for organisations at Level 5 maturity—using open source as a strategic lever to shape the technology landscape.

At this level, open source moves beyond operational efficiency to become a strategic tool.   Mature organisations don't just consume the open source landscape—they shape it through strategic contribution, project creation, and foundation leadership.

**See:** [Leveraging Open Source as a Strategy](Leveraging-Strategically) for the components of strategy (landscape, climate, doctrine, leadership, purpose), how OSPOs contribute to technology decisions, and strategy as an evolutionary process.

**See:** [Why Create An Open Source Project](Why-To-Create-A-Project) for the strategic rationale behind hosting your own projects.

**See:** [Open Source Strategy Presentation](/docs/Presentations/Strategy) for Victor Lu and Rob Moffat's deep dive on connecting open source to corporate strategy, Porter's generic strategies applied to open source, and engaging upward with executives.

**See:** [Frank Nagle on the $9T Value of Open Source](/docs/Presentations/Value-Of-Open-Source) for research showing that contribution—not just consumption—unlocks outsized strategic gains.
