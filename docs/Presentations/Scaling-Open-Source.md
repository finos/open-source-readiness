Elspeth Minty, Brittany Istenes, Peter Smulovics and Rob Moffat.

In this session, we dig into the future of open source in financial services—why it’s no longer just about innovation, but survival. The panel explores what Open Source Readiness really means today: the role of OSPOs inside banks, the exponential growth of AI, codebases, and vulnerabilities, and the second-order effects reshaping risk, regulation, and software supply chains. We unpack why financial institutions must shift culturally, structurally, and strategically—embracing governance, boosting contributions, and even considering a Chief Open Source Officer—if they want to stay ahead of the curve. Expect candid discussion, challenging questions, and a look at practical tools, maturity models, and training that can help FSIs move from passive consumers to active stewards of the open source ecosystem.
