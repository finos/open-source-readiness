In this recorded session, Mike hosted a meeting focused on the evolving landscape of open source security, particularly around vulnerabilities, supply-chain challenges, and governance practices. Mike opened the call, welcomed attendees, and ensured the session was being properly recorded before guiding the discussion forward.

The group talked through the increasing complexity of managing open source dependencies, noting how even widely adopted libraries occasionally introduced breaking changes or hidden risks. Participants reflected on several recent vulnerabilities and discussed how organisations had been adapting their internal processes to keep pace with the growing scale of open source usage.

Mike emphasised the need for stronger controls, improved transparency, and better tooling to support secure development, especially as dependency chains became deeper and more opaque. He also highlighted the importance of cross-industry collaboration and open governance models to help maintain a safer and more resilient open source ecosystem.

The session concluded with attendees acknowledging that, despite progress, open source security remained a rapidly shifting area — and that continued cooperation across the industry would be essential.
