title: Welcome to Open Source Readiness!
---

The Open Source Readiness Special Interest Group (OSR SIG) is dedicated to helping financial services firms advance their open source programs. Here's what we have to offer:

- **[Meetings](Meetings)** of the SIG are held on the first Wednesday of each month at 10am US/Eastern, and are open to anyone who would like to participate. Meetings include group discussions of open source best practices, guest presentations from open source experts, and collaborative sessions to produce resources for the industry.

- We produce and collect **[Resources](osr-resources)** to support FSI firms in developing robust open source programs, including:
   - A [Presentation on Open Source Readiness](osr-resources/Presentation) explaining why we need this project.
   - The [Open Source Body of Knowledge](bok/Introduction) is a collaborative project aimed at developing a comprehensive body of knowledge on open source best practices for the financial services industry.
   - Comprehensive [Training and Certification](osr-resources/Training) materials that firms can use to train and certify developers for open source contribution in a financial services setting. 
   - An [Open Source License Compliance Handbook](https://github.com/finos/OSLC-handbook) with information about complying with common open source licenses
   - An [executive whitepaper](https://www.finos.org/business-value-of-open-source-for-financial-services-firms-download-page?hsLang=en-us) on the business value of open source
   - A [reference open source policy](https://github.com/finos/reference-foss-policy) for FSI firms. 
 
- **[Media](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmPXh6nBuhJu2t82wVBNY0ld-RbIAdaPL)** from guest presentations and SIG sessions provides invaluable insights from experts and FSI colleagues on a range of topics related to open source usage, contribution, and compliance.
