## FINOS OSR Resources

The OSR SIG has produced several resources to help financial services firms along their open source journey. Most of these are also [open source projects](docs/projects) that you can contribute to on GitHub.

### Open Source License Compliance Handbook

A guide for complying with a wide range of open source licenses in common use cases. It's an invaluable resource for enabling developers to manage the most common compliance tasks without unnecessary legal and compliance review.
