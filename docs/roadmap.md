---

This document contains an inital Open Source Readiness roadmap as contributed in [2022 Community Roadmap #23](https://github.com/finos/open-source-readiness/discussions/23#discussioncomment-2253788).

## High Level Description

At a high level, OSR should be an engine to identify shared, financial services specific, challenges to open source participation from financial institutions.

The SIG should prioritize the challenges and then foster the creation of projects that address them.

## OSR Responsibilities

The following lists the 2022 responsibilities of the Open Source Readiness SIG.

### Prioritizing common areas of challenge for financial institutions in progressing through the OS maturity model

- Through prioritization of a backlog (e.g. github issues) at OSR SIG meetings.
- Processing output of the [OSMM](https://github.com/finos/osmm) survey responses FINOS receives.
- Through real-life findings FINOS can feed in (e.g. Member XX cannot use DCOs, Member YY canâ€™t access github, etc).

### Explore and develop regulators role in the Open Source maturity of the industry, in conjunction with the FINOS Innovation Regulation SIG

- Between [this discussion](https://groups.google.com/a/finos.org/g/osr/c/GMMD38RkaMY/m/nYMwTdR3BAAJ) on the list and this [github discussion](https://github.com/finos/open-source-readiness/discussions/9), consolidating a shared list of common regulatory requirements industry is concerned about
- Then, mapping to existing solutions (or start open sources project to address them).

### Support the definition and evolution of a truly industry-wide OSMM

- Provide / solicit ongoing Feedback and validation of OSMM ahead of FINOS OSMM launch
- Participate and amplify FINOS OSMM launch
- Promote participants and adjacent communities to take the survey
- Propose training / certifications to strengthen the value proposition of OSMM for all constituents

### Promote the importance of OSR in FSI and create proven-to-be-successful solutions

- Produce case studies of how FSIs are successfully moving through the OSR journey
- Source speakers and content for FINOS OSR Marketing (e.g. meetups, blogs, papers, OSSF)
- Spin off projects to address common areas of challenge as prioritized by the SIG (see point above)

### Define and own relationship with peer (e.g.Reg SIG, Innersource SIG, DevOps SIG) and upstream initiatives (e.g. TODO group, OpenSSF)

# Implementing the OSR SIG Roadmap

To help accelerate the OSR SIG roadmap, the following labels have been added to the OSR repo in GitHub that can be applied to GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

### Open Source Readiness GitHub Labels

- `osr-relationship-building`
- `open-source-readiness-promotion`
- `open-source-maturity-model`
- `regulatory-requirement`
- `financial-institution-challenge`

These labels are available to help with the triaging of ideas, issues and feedback that are posted by the OSR SIG community.
