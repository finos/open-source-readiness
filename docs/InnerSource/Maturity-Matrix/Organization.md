    multiple stakeholders.
  - No formal actions exists at the organization.

- Level 1

  - Individuals and teams give visibility to their plans or products to multiple
    stakeholders, before they are started.
  - Shared roadmap.

- Level 2

  - There are already shared roadmaps with clear guidelines and contribution
    rules where stakeholders can provide feedback.
  - However this is not standardized across the organization and not all of the
    projects provide this info.

- Level 3
  - Roadmaps are shared by default and there is a standard process and
    homogeneous way to do this across the organization at the level of each
    InnerSource project.
  - This contains clear rules to contribute and influence in the roadmap.

### Decisions

- Level 0

  - Decision-makers often intentionally or accidentally withhold data and
    resources related to project decisions.

  - Materials that are part of decision-making practices become available for
    review after decisions are finalized.

- Level 2

  - People feel like they know about—and are helping to shape—most (but not all)
    important decisions as those decisions are unfolding.
  - Materials that are part of decision-making practices are available at
    defined project milestones

- Level 3
  - People feel like they are a part of a shared, standard process for
    collective decision-making that the organization endorses.
  - Materials that are part of decision-making practices are continuously
    accessible during work processes.

### Helpful Resources

- Level 0

    they've finished their work.
  - Individuals and teams share resources, but in disconnected, fragmented, or
    individualized/siloed systems or repositories.

- Level 2

  - Individuals and teams make project-related materials accessible to some
    members of project teams according to clearly defined and shared formats
    and/or protocols.
  - Individuals and teams withhold sensitive data and resources, provide limited
    details, context, and scope.
  - There are enterprise wide tools for knowledge sharing, but they are not
    widely adopted
  - Efforts to consolidate and curate information is a continued effort

- Level 3
  - Individuals and teams make project-related materials broadly accessible to
    the organization — and possibly outside the organization as well — according
    to clearly defined and shared formats and/or protocols.
  - Individuals and teams who must withhold sensitive data and resources are
    clear about what they're not sharing, and others understand why those
    materials are not available to them.
  - The organization has clearly defined sharing protocols that are followed.
  - Data, knowledge or tool duplication is minimized
  - Individuals and teams who must withhold sensitive data and resources are
    clear about what they're not sharing, and others understand why those
